# Higher-Or-Lower-Game
Higher Or Lower Guessing Game made in Python 
I made this game with a random number range between 1 and 100 
First, the program prints out a number and the user has to guess "h"(higher) or "l"(lower) 
If the user guesses correctly then there score gets updated, but if they guess wrong than the game is over 
Very fun game to code with not a lot of difficulty
